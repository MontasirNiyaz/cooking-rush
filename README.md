# Cooking Rush

A time-management cooking game for Roblox, built on a **fully data-driven architecture**: adding a brand-new restaurant — its ingredients, recipes, stations, customers, and 40 levels — requires writing a single config file and **zero new engine code**.

The engine knows nothing about burgers or sushi. It knows about *archetypes* (a station that cooks, a station that dispenses, a station that assembles) and resolves everything else from data at runtime.

---

## Why data-driven?

Most cooking games hard-code each dish. Here, the entire content layer is declarative config under `ReplicatedStorage/Shared/Config/`, and a small set of pure-logic modules interpret it:

| Concern | Where it lives | Engine code needed to extend? |
|---------|----------------|-------------------------------|
| Ingredients & items | `Config/Ingredients.lua` | None |
| Recipes (cook / assemble graphs) | `Config/Recipes.lua` | None |
| Stations & their behaviour | `Config/Stations.lua` (`archetype` field) | None |
| Customer types & patience | `Config/Customers.lua` | None |
| Upgrade trees | `Config/Upgrades.lua` | None |
| Recipe mastery curve | `Config/Mastery.lua` | None (one global curve covers every recipe) |
| Prestige / franchise curve | `Config/Prestige.lua` | None (formula params only) |
| Chefs (collectible pets) | `Config/Chefs.lua` | None — a chef is a config row; only a *new passive tag* touches code |
| Recruitment crates (gacha) | `Config/RecruitCrates.lua` | None (cost + weighted drop table + pity) |
| A whole restaurant + its levels | `Config/Restaurants/<Name>.lua` | None |

The **M6 milestone** exists specifically to prove this: adding the *Sushi* restaurant is a config-only change.

## Station archetypes

Every station is one of three archetypes. Behaviour is selected by the `archetype` field in `Stations.lua` — the difference between a Grill and a Fryer is entirely data (`cookTime`, `burnTime`, `input`, `output`).

- **Cooker** — accepts a raw input, cooks it over `cookTime`, burns it after `burnTime`. Slot-based. (Grill, Fryer, Soup Pot, Fish Prep)
- **Dispenser** — produces an item on demand from finite `stock`, refilling over `refillTime`. Ingredient shelves use effectively-infinite stock. (Drink Dispenser, ingredient shelves)
- **Assembler** — collects a base + toppings and matches them against recipe steps to produce a finished dish. (Assembly Counter, Sushi Roller)

The player carries **one item at a time**. Interacting with a station either places the held item, picks one up, or does nothing — disambiguated by a two-value return `(outputItem: string?, consumed: boolean)`.

**Server is authoritative.** `EconomyService` is the only writer of coins/gems in the entire codebase; the client is never trusted for currency amounts.

---

## Tech stack

- **Luau** with `--!strict` throughout
- **[Rojo](https://rojo.space/)** 7.6.1 for filesystem ↔ Studio sync (managed via [Rokit](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rokit))
- **TestEZ** for unit specs
- Lightweight **Signal** and **Trove** packages for events and cleanup

---

## Getting started

1. Install [Rokit](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rokit), then install the toolchain:
   ```sh
   rokit install
   ```
2. Start the Rojo server:
   ```sh
   rojo serve
   ```
3. In Roblox Studio, connect via the Rojo plugin, then press **Play**.

When running inside Studio, the client auto-starts FastFood level 1 after a short delay for convenience. The HUD shows coins, combo multiplier, the held item, and the level state. Walk up to a station (or a customer's seat) and press **E**.

> **Note:** the in-world kitchen (station Parts under `Workspace.Stations` and seats under `Workspace.Seats`) is built in the place file, not in source. Each station Part carries a `StationId` attribute that the client maps to its config. `Workspace.StreamingEnabled` must be **off** or the controllers won't see the Parts at startup.

---

## Testing

Unit specs live in `tests/` (TestEZ format) and cover the pure-logic modules — `RecipeResolver`, `EconomyMath` (including the M7 mastery & prestige math), `LevelGenerator`, `UpgradeMath`, and the M8 `GachaMath` (weighted rolling + pity) and `ChefMath` (passive aggregation, equip slots, fusion) — which contain all the rules and no Roblox side effects, so they're cheap to test in isolation. Current suite: **116/116 passing**.

The specs are synced to `ServerStorage.Tests` alongside a small **`TestRunner`** module. To run the whole suite inside Studio, enter Play mode and execute (command bar set to *Server*, or via the MCP `execute_luau`):

```lua
require(game.ServerStorage.Tests.TestRunner).runAll()
```

It prints `[Tests] N passed, M failed` and warns one line per failure. `TestRunner` provides just the slice of the TestEZ DSL the specs use (`describe`, `it`, `expect(x).to.equal(y)`, `expect(x).to.be.ok()`), injected via `setfenv` — so the specs run unmodified without vendoring the full TestEZ library.

## Roadmap

| Milestone | Scope | Status |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| **M0** | Project skeleton, full config layer, pure-logic modules, server/client stubs | ✅ Done |
| **M1** | Three station archetypes wired to 3D interaction; serve a cheeseburger end-to-end | ✅ Done |
| **M2** | Full level state machine (Intro → Playing → Results), patience meters, combo, timer, star calc | ✅ Done |
| **M3** | Wire `LevelGenerator` into `LevelController`; tune the 40-level difficulty curve; run specs | ✅ Done |
| **M4** | DataStore-backed profiles; server-side `SubmitLevelResult` validation; daily reward | ✅ Done |
| **M5** | Restaurant unlocks; upgrade trees applied as modifiers; Shop / Upgrade UI | ✅ Done |
| **M6** | Add the **Sushi** restaurant as pure config — proving zero engine code changes | ✅ Done |
| **M7** | Meta-progression spine: **Recipe Mastery** (per-dish grind ladder) + **Restaurant Prestige** (franchise-for-multiplier loop, Prestige Tokens) | ✅ Done |
| **M8** | **Chef Collection & Recruitment** — rarity-tiered collectible chefs, server-authoritative gacha with pity, equip/fusion, passive effect-tags consumed by the existing engine | ✅ Done |

M7–M8 layer the incremental-growth meta over the M0–M6 single-restaurant loop. The systems are formula + config: no new content is authored, they multiply the value of every restaurant the generator already produces. **Chefs** are the collection hook — a 200-chef roster is just rows in `Chefs.lua`; their passives (`cookSpeedMult`, `tipMult`, `burnImmuneChance`, `autoServe`) are effect tags the existing stations/economy already consume. See the [`COOKING_GAME_SPEC` M7–M12 roadmap](HANDOFF.md) for what's next (M9 idle, M10 live-ops, M11 trading, M12 monetization).

See [`HANDOFF.md`](HANDOFF.md) for detailed architecture notes, design decisions, and the per-milestone implementation plan.
